This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of Andreas Ley's
mailto program.

This package was put together by Martin Schulze <joey@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from:
 ftp://ftp.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/net/www/tools/cgi-src/mailto.tar.gz

One mirror still seems to exist:
 http://www-ftp.lip6.fr/ftp/pub/www/more-tools/cgi-src/mailto.tar.gz

Both sites only contained mailto up to version 1.2.6.

The upstream packages for 1.2.7, 1.3, 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 were sent to
Joey via private mail and not released to the abovely mentioned
Internet address.

Version 1.3.2 is also the final upstream version which only exists on
a tape library archive and isn't in use anymore.  Hence, the Debian
package became the new source for this package.

mailto has been released under the GNU General Public License.
